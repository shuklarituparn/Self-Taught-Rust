/*
Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.
The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it.

/*
Scalar Types

A scalar type represents a single value.
Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.

/*
To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use these families of methods provided by
the standard library for primitive numeric types:

    Wrap in all modes with the "wrapping_*" methods, such as "wrapping_add"
    Return the None value if there is overflow with the "checked_*" methods.
    Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the "overflowing_*" methods.
    Saturate at the valueâ€™s minimum or maximum values with the "saturating_*" methods.
