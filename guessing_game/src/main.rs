/*
Mutability in Rust follows the name, not the value. So if you have a value that is bound to a
mutable variable, and you want it to be immutable, all you have to do is rebind it:
fn main() {
    let mut nth_term = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut nth_term).expect("I/O error");
    let nth_term = nth_term;
    //  ^^^^^^^^-- no `mut`
}
 */

/*
fn main() {
    let nth_term = {
        let mut nth_term = String::new();
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut nth_term).expect("I/O error");
        nth_term
    };
}
You can also put the original binding in a block expression to minimize the scope of the mut variable:
