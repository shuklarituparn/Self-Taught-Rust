/*
BufRead is a type of Reader which has an internal buffer, allowing it to perform extra ways of reading.

For example, reading line-by-line is inefficient without using a buffer, so if you want to read by
line, youâ€™ll need BufRead, which includes a read_line method as well as a lines iterator

/*
Note that you cannot use the ? operator in functions that do not return a Result<T, E>.
Instead, you can call .unwrap() or match on the return value to catch any possible errors:

//parse converts the string into int.
//trim removes all the whitespaces
